<h2>FARMDATA Guest User's Guide</h2>
 updated 5/24/14
</center>
<p>
Welcome!  Thank you for visiting FARMDATA, a project of the Dickinson 
College Farm (DCF), and Dickinson College Department of 
Mathematics and Computer Science.  The following guidelines are meant to 
assist first time users in understanding FARMDATA's various functions. 
As a guest, you can view the majority of FARMDATA's pages, with the 
exception of customer invoicing and other administrative functions.  
Guests can run reports to see data from the DCF's 2013 cropping year.  
Guests can also use the input pages, although actual input to the database 
is disabled.    You can access FARMDATA from any web browser, including 
desktops and smartphones.  The 2013 mobile version of FARMDATA displays best
on iPhones but may also be viewed on other platforms.
<p>
We hope that FARMDATA's data entry and reporting forms are intuitive, and you 
may have little need for the information below.  However, those with an 
interest in understanding the full depth of the portal's function are 
encouraged to skim these instructions.   You may wish to print this guide for 
easy reference while you explore FARMDATA.

<h3>SEED MENU</h3>

This is a good place to start!  The seed menu contains pages for inputting
direct seeding and transplanting information.  Crops must be "seeded" into
existence before FARMDATA's other pages will recognize them for further
data entry.  For example, users cannot record harvest data for a crop in a
particular field unless that planting has been previously logged in the
present year.  

<h4>Input forms:</h4>
<ul>
<li> These include Direct Seeding, Flats Seeding, and Transplant Forms.  The
 following example references the Direct Seeding input form:
<li> After opening an input form, the user chooses a date.  Dates 
 automatically default to the present day, but seedings may be backdated
 using the dropdown menus.  The user then chooses a field ID and crop from
 the drop down menus.  These menus have been pre-loaded with field and crop
 names used at the Dickinson College Farm (DCF).  
<li> Next the user inputs the number of bed feet and rows per bed seeded.
 FARMDATA automatically calculates the number of row feet seeded,
 which is the basic building block of our crop management system at DCF.
<li> Users have the option of adding text notes to all input forms.  In the
 case of seeding forms, we use the comments window to add variety info.
 (Note that the Flats Seeding form has a separate varieties window for this
  purpose.)
<li> Functions of the Flats and Transplant forms are similar to Direct Seeding.
 Note that a crop must first be "created" in Flats before it can be
 transplanted to the field.
<li> Once crops are Direct Seeded or Transplanted, then they are available in
 further pages for harvesting, spraying, scouting, etc.
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Report forms:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Each input table in FARMDATA has its partner in reporting forms, 
 to enable the user to access recorded data.  Report forms are handy for
 immediate use in the field (for example, to double check that a record was
 entered correctly) and for mid or end-of-season season analysis.
<li> To run a report, choose a form, then select a date range and crop.  
 Date ranges automatically default to the present day.  To see the data for
 the whole season, set the beginning date as sometime in January, or choose
 some smaller date window for more specific activities.
<li> Users have the option to select a specific crop from the drop down menu,
 or choose ALL to see all activities for all crops in the data table.     
<li> Example:  On a Direct Seeding report, set the date range for January 1
 to the present date, then choose LETTUCE, MES MIX as the crop.  This will
 show all mesclun mix seedings for the year. The report window automatically
 calculates the total row feet seeded for this crop.   Change the crop to 
 ALL to see all seedings for the year.
<li> Example 2:  On the Transplant report form, set the date range to 
 January - Present, and select LETTUCE or BROCCOLI as the crop.  These will
 show you all recorded plantings of these crops since July of 2013.  FARMDATA
 also calculates the average days in flat for the crops shown in the report. 
 This info is helpful for greenhouse management planning.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>HARVEST MENU</h3>

Harvest is a good next stop for guests.  Seeding and harvesting make up the
core data set for basic farm management.  Our goal at DCF is to record
100% of all harvests, so that we can accurately compare yields between
fields and calculate the yield per unit area figures that are the key to
our field planning.  
<p>
Users can input harvests in two ways.  One is from a <b>harvest list</b> that
is created on big harvest days by farm managers (this "create list" function
is not shown on the guest page).  To view a harvest list, click on the
appropriate submenu under the Harvest menu.  Choose a date - to see an
actual list, choose a recent Monday (i.e. November 11, November 18, etc.). 
At DCF we create harvest lists on Mondays and Thursdays, but as of
November 2013 we are only harvesting on Mondays due to the winter slowdown.
<!--
Due to a technicality in the current version of FARMDATA software,
complete harvest lists may not be visible for more than a week after their
creation.  For this reason choosing the most recent Monday may yield the
most interesting results.       
-->
<p>
At any rate, from a harvest list, a user has a few options.  First, you
can view an expanded harvest list by clicking the link at the bottom of
the page.  This will show the details of what goes into making up the totals
to be harvested - in our case we have columns for CSA, Farmers Market,
Dining Hall, and Other.  FARMDATA sums up these columns to populate the
"Total" column.  
<p>
Any member of the field crew with a smartphone can interact with the harvest
list.  (We also print a copy of the list for our analog crew.)  
As crops are harvested, crew members click on the highlighted crop name in
the left hand column.  This action takes users to the "Input New
Harvest" page, and automatically sets the crop name to match the one
clicked in the previous screen.  
<p>
On the Input New Harvest page, users choose a Field ID from the drop down
menu.  The available options in this menu will only be fields where the
chosen crop has been registered as planted in the current year.  This
feature minimizes worker confusion and data input errors.  The user then
inputs the harvest quantity and chooses the appropriate unit for the crop
harvested.  There is also a window for adding comments (i.e. "small heads"
or "last harvest this planting", etc.).  
<p>
Once all data fields are completed, the user clicks "submit" (or "go"
on an iPhone).  This will produce a confirmation screen, which allows the
user to check the submission before it is added to the database.  While
guests cannot enter actual data, in practice once the user clicks OK,
FARMDATA returns a message confirming successful data entry.
<p>
If working from the Harvest List, a user can return to the list with a
single click at the bottom of the harvest input form.  Following data
entry, the Harvested column at the far right of the harvest list will show
the total quantity harvested thus far.  Once the Harvested column exceeds
the Total (to be harvested) column, the data row for that crop will move
to the bottom of the page, and the background color will change to signify
that the harvest goal for that crop has been met for the day.  FARMDATA
will sum up the quantity of a crop harvested from different fields,
and allows multiple users to input data from different fields at the
same time.  Each user's view of the harvest list is automatically
refreshed once per minute to prevent confusion when harvesters are working
in different fields.
<p>
Users can also enter a new harvest directly without using the harvest list. 
This is handy on days when we are only harvesting a few crops for daily
maintenance (i.e. zucchini) or for special orders.    Harvest data can also
be backdated in the event that they are missed on the day the crops were
picked.
<p>
With very little practice, harvest data entry became fast and routine for
the 2013 DCF field crew.  We often would enter harvest data while walking or
driving between fields - each entry session typically requires less than one
minute per crop.  The beauty of FARMDATA is that once our crew has invested
this time for data entry, the records are permanently digitized and do not
need to be keyed in a second time at the end of the season. 
 
<h4>Harvest Report:</h4> 
 Users can access the harvest data table at any time by running a harvest
report.  For example, if you set the date range from January 2013 to present,
and select TOMATO, ALL Fields, you will see our total tomato harvest for
2013, including a yield per row foot calculation. You can also do TOMATO
for just field V or just field J to see a more precise record for the same
date range. The yield per row foot calculations are derived from data
stored from planting records for the year versus actual inputted harvest. 
We will use these figures to do our crop planning next season, as well as to
compare productivity between fields.  In the above example, you may note
that field V's yield per row foot is much greater than field J, due to J
being killed by late blight just at the beginning of its harvest window.  
<p>

<h3>OTHER PAGES</h3>

We hope that after following the above tutorial, using FARMDATA's other
pages will become intuitive for you.  The <b>"Notes"</b> menu is a simple
portal for entering dated text notes.  This comes in handy for anything
not otherwise covered by FARMDATA, or in the event of a temporary glitch
in the data entry software.  The remaining pages are under the
<b>"Soil"</b> menu. While we the development team think they are all nifty,
 useful and elegant in their own right, the following pages are particularly
noteworthy:

<h4>Cover Crop Seeding input form:</h4>  
This handy input form has our field sizes (in acres) pre-loaded into
a background table.  It also accesses seeding rates for our commonly used
cover crop species.  The seeding rates are displayed as a range
(specific to each cover crop) so that the user may choose to adjust the
seeding rate up or down depending on field conditions, time of year,
mixtures etc.  Once a user chooses the field, percent of field seeded,
and seeding rate for each cover crop, FARMDATA calculates the actual pounds
of seed needed.  This in-field calculation, done through FARMDATA on a
smartphone, enables the user to seed cover crops in a hurry without
needing to look up field and crop tables, or do math.  In 2013, we found
the extra minutes saved by using this function to be quite helpful on
several occasions, particularly before foul weather or darkness.
 
<h4>Insect Scouting input form:</h4>
This form is useful for Integrated Pest Management (IPM).  We use it for
tracking pest pressure in fields when making spray decisions, either
before spraying to determine pest thresholds, or after spraying to
verify effectiveness of control.  After choosing a date, field, pest,
and crop from dropdown menus, the user chooses the number of plants
she will sample in the given field.  This populates the screen with
the appropriate number of input windows according to the number of
plants chosen.  The user then records her findings for each plant in
the successive windows, after which FARMDATA will calculate the
average number of pests per plant for that scouting.  Once the form is
submitted, these records are added to the data table for future
verification and study.

<h4>Tractor Spraying input form:</h4> 
 This input form is the masterpiece of the 2013 software development team. 
Like Cover Crop Seeding, the pre-loaded field size and spray rate tables,
and the automatic calculations used by this input form result in big time
savings in the field.  At DCF in 2013, <b><i>every</i></b> field spraying
was logged into the permanent database <b><i>because</i></b> our spray
personnel came to depend on the convenience of this form.
<ul>
<li> In the first screen, the user inputs the date, number of fields to be
sprayed, and the number of materials to be sprayed.  Clicking submit
takes the user to a secondary input screen.  
<li> Here, the user chooses the appropriate field ID’s and number of beds
per field, which FARMDATA uses to calculate the acreage sprayed from field
data stored in background tables.  You will notice that changing the field
letter, or the number of beds per field, will change the acres listed in
the windows at right.
<li> Next, the user chooses the materials sprayed from a pre-loaded drop down
menu, followed by the rate per acre for each material.  FARMDATA lists 
he correct units, and possible spray rates for each material from a
range stored in a background table.  After the user chooses the material
and rate, FARMDATA calculates the appropriate amount of material to use for
the total acres to be sprayed.  A similar process is used to calculate
the total gallons of water to be added to the spray tank based on user inputs.
<li> Following choice of crop group and input of any "reason for spray"
or comments, the user clicks submit.  This prompts a confirmation screen
which prevents the user from accidentally inputting incorrect data.
</ul>

Guest users can not input spraying records, but are able to
run a Tractor Spraying report to access the spray
data table.  In 2013 we used this to look up recent spray dates, and to
track total amounts of each spray material used over the whole season. 
For example, if you run a report from January 2013 to present and choose
ALL fields, CHAMP WG, you will see the total of this material used for
the year.  This data is helpful for planning next year’s materials
purchases.  By choosing a specific field (J for example) and CHAMP WG,
you can see how much of this material was applied to that particular area. 
This data helps us ensure compliance with maximum annual usage guidelines
specified on the CHAMP WG label. 
<p>


<h3>POST SCRIPT</h3>

What guests can't see on the guest page is an Admin section, where we can
develop harvest lists, add crops,users, and products, delete records, and
generate electronic invoices that are automatically emailed to our customers.
Plans for new pages in 2014 include a field labor hours tracking form for
per-crop cost analysis, and soil test input and nutrient amendment input
forms for verification of organic system plan compliance.
<p>
Dropdown menus on the input forms reference background tables specific to
the Dickinson College Farm - for example, field ID's and sizes, pest species,
cover crops, etc.  In 2014 we are proposing to experimentally customize
FARMDATA for two additional farms in our neighborhood.  This will require
the creation of "setup templates" for the background tables specific to
those farms.  If the 2014 feasibility study is successful, the software will
be packaged and released either as open source technology or through the
local third party organic certifier.
<p>
The system still has a few bugs that we are actively working on smoothing out.
But since early July of 2013, we have been able to digitally capture about
90% of our planting and harvest records, all of our spray records, and all
of our cover crop seeding and compost applications for the fall.  We've
also eliminated daily paper invoices for our principal produce client,
and have eliminated the tedious step of digitizing our vital records for
the 2013 season.
