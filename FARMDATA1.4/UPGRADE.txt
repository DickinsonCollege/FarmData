To upgrade from FARMDATA1.0, to FARMDATA1.1, you must adjust several
of the tables in your farm information database.  Connect to that
database from phpMyAdmin or a terminal and execute the the following
commands.  In phpMyAdmin, paste the commands into the "Run SQL Query"
box and click "Go":

alter table coverCrop drop column id;
alter table coverCrop add column active tinyint(1) default 1 after legume;
alter table tSprayMaterials modify column REI_HRS varchar(20);
alter table gh_seeding add column gen int default 1 after cellsFlat;
alter table dir_planted add column gen int default 1 after hours;
alter table transferred_to add column gen int default 1 after flats;
alter table harvested add column gen int default 1 after unit;
alter table config add column gens tinyint(1) default 1 after bedft;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.1 to FARMDATA1.2, you must adjust one
additional table in your farm information database.  The necessary
command is:

alter table distribution add column pricePerUnit double default 0 after unit;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.0 to FARMDATA1.2, first use the commands above
to upgrade to FARMDATA1.1, then upgrade to FARMDATA1.2.  You do NOT need

alter table product add column active tinyint(1) default 1;
alter table tSprayField add column crops text;
update tSprayField set crops = (select crops from tSprayMaster where 
  tSprayMaster.id = tSprayField.id);
alter table tSprayMaster drop column crops;
