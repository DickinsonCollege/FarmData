Planning Your FARMDATA Installation

Before installing FARMDATA, make sure that:
  - you have console (terminal) access to your web server
  - your server is running Linux or some other flavor of Unix
  - your server has PHP (version 5.3 or higher) and MySQL Server (version 5.1
    or higher)
  - you know your domain name (i.e. web server hostname)
  - you know whether or not your web server provides Secure Sockets Layer
    (SSL) via an SSL certificate.  Running FARMDATA over SSL is highly
    recommended.
  - you know the full path to the document root directory for your web server
    (that is, the directory that your web server serves files from).  If you
    have a dedicated server, the document root directory will be something like
     "/var/www/html".  If you have a shared hosting account, the document root
    directory will likely be a subdirectory of your home directory. 
  - you know the subdirectory of the document root directory in which you would 
    like to install FARMDATA.  The installation procedure will create this 
    subdirectory if it doesn't exist.  Installing directly in the document root
    directory will work, but is not recommended unless your web server will
    be used for FARMDATA only.  If you install FARMDATA in the document root
    directory, the URL for FARMDATA will just be the hostname of your server.
    If you install in a subdirectory of the document root directory, the URL
    will be: https://your.server.name/subdirectory.name
    (http://your.server.name/subdirectory.name if you are not using SSL)
  - you know whether your webserver is also the machine that is running MySQL.
    If not, you also need to know the name of that machine, and to create and
    populate the databases on that machine before running the install
    procedure.
  - you decide whether to have the installation procedure create the necessary
    MySQL databases for you, or if you would like to create those databases
    yourself.

      - If you decide to have the installation procedure create the databases,
       you will need to enter the username and password for a MySQL
       administrator account on your system - that is, a user that can create
       databases and additional database users.  You will be prompted for 
       this username and password during the installation procedure.
      - If you create the databases yourself (recommended in a shared hosting
       environment), create two MySQL databases.  One will be used for
       storing user account information, and the second for storing the 
       actual planting, harvesting, ... data.  You will also need to create
       a user for each database with full privileges on that database.
       You MUST create a separate user for each database.  You will be
       prompted for the name of each database, user and password
       during the installation procedure.  After installation, adjust the
       privileges for each user as follows:
         - the user for the user account information database needs select,
           insert and update privileges on that database (remove all others)
         - the user for the farm information database needs lock tables,
           select, delete, insert, show view and update privileges on that
           database (remove all others)
          
  - you have chosen a username and password for your FARMDATA account.
    The installation procedure will create this account for you, and you will
    be able to use this account to create additional users within FARMDATA.

Installing FARMDATA
  - cd into the directory in which you unpacked the FARMDATA source (which
    should be the directory that contains this file)
  - execute the command:  ./install.sh
  - the install procedure will prompt you for the information listed above
  - report any installation issues by creating a ticket at:
https://sourceforge.net/p/farmdata/tickets/
  Make sure to copy and paste any error messages into your ticket. 

To begin using FARMDATA, go to the URL specified above and log in with the
username and password that you specified during the installation.
