To upgrade from FARMDATA1.0, to FARMDATA1.1, you must adjust several
of the tables in your farm information database.  Connect to that
database from phpMyAdmin or a terminal and execute the the following
commands.  In phpMyAdmin, paste the commands into the "Run SQL Query"
box and click "Go":

alter table coverCrop drop column id;
alter table coverCrop add column active tinyint(1) default 1 after legume;
alter table tSprayMaterials modify column REI_HRS varchar(20);
alter table gh_seeding add column gen int default 1 after cellsFlat;
alter table dir_planted add column gen int default 1 after hours;
alter table transferred_to add column gen int default 1 after flats;
alter table harvested add column gen int default 1 after unit;
alter table config add column gens tinyint(1) default 1 after bedft;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.1 to FARMDATA1.2, you must adjust one
additional table in your farm information database.  The necessary
command is:

alter table distribution add column pricePerUnit double default 0 after unit;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.0 to FARMDATA1.2, first use the commands above
to upgrade to FARMDATA1.1, then upgrade to FARMDATA1.2.  You do NOT need
to install the code for FARMDATA1.1 to upgrade to FARMDATA1.2.
