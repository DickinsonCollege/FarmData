To upgrade to a new version of FARMDATA while keeping your existing databases
(and their contents):

  1. download the new version of FARMDATA and unpack it.  We will refer to this
     version as FARMDATA1.X.
  2. copy the config file that was created when you installed FARMDATA from the
     original installation directory into the FARMDATA1.X directory that was
     created in the previous step.
  3. cd into the FARMDATA1.X directory
  4. execute the command:  ./install.sh
  5. the install procedure will ask you to accept the license agreement, and
     whether your web server supports SSL.  If you have obtained an SSL certificate
     since installing FARMDATA, you can upgrade FARMDATA to run over SSL by
     answering "y" here.
  6. the install procedure will detect the config file and ask you
     whether you wish to upgrade your existing FARMDATA or to do a new
     installation.  If you decide to do a new installation, delete both databases
     created during your initial FARMDATA installation before proceeding.  If you
     decide to upgrade your existing FARMDATA, the install procedure will configure
     the new source files and copy them to the installation directory, but will
     leave your existing databases unchanged.

  NOTE: to upgrade by multiple versions, follow the upgrade instructions 
  for each intermediate version.  For example, to upgrade from FARMDATA 1.2
  to FARMDATA 1.5, first make the table modifications specified below for
  upgrading from FARMDATA 1.2 to FARMDATA 1.3, and then the modifications
  for upgrading from FARMDATA 1.3 to 1.4 (none in that case), and then 
  finally the modifications for upgrading from FARMDATA 1.4 to 1.5.  You
  only need to upgrade the code for the version you are upgrading to - 
  that is, you do not need to download the code for and upgrade to FARMDATA 1.3
  and 1.4 to upgrade from FARMDATA 1.2 to 1.5.

  To upgrade from FARMDATA1.0, to FARMDATA1.1, you must adjust several
  of the tables in your farm information database (in addition to upgrading the
  code).  Connect to that database from phpMyAdmin or a terminal and execute the
  following commands.  In phpMyAdmin, paste the commands into the "Run SQL Query"
  box and click "Go":

alter table coverCrop drop column id;
alter table coverCrop add column active tinyint(1) default 1 after legume;
alter table tSprayMaterials modify column REI_HRS varchar(20);
alter table gh_seeding add column gen int default 1 after cellsFlat;
alter table dir_planted add column gen int default 1 after hours;
alter table transferred_to add column gen int default 1 after flats;
alter table harvested add column gen int default 1 after unit;
alter table config add column gens tinyint(1) default 1 after bedft;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.1 to FARMDATA1.2, you must adjust one
additional table in your farm information database.  The necessary
command is:

alter table distribution add column pricePerUnit double default 0 after unit;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.2 to FARMDATA1.3, you must adjust several tables
in your farm information database.  The necessary commands are:

alter table comments add column id int auto_increment primary key;
alter table product add column active tinyint(1) default 1;
alter table tSprayField add column crops text;
update tSprayField set crops = (select crops from tSprayMaster where 
  tSprayMaster.id = tSprayField.id);
alter table tSprayMaster drop column crops;

No table modifications are needed to upgrade from FARMDATA1.3 to FARMDATA1.4.

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.4 to FARMDATA1.5, you must adjust several tables in
your farm information database.  The necessary commands are:

alter table utilized_on modify fieldSpread float;
alter table dir_planted add column annual tinyint(1) default 1;
alter table dir_planted add column lastHarvest date;
update dir_planted set lastHarvest = concat(year(plantdate), '-12-31');
alter table dir_planted modify lastHarvest date not null;
alter table dir_planted modify plantdate date not null;
alter table transferred_to add column annual tinyint(1) default 1;
alter table transferred_to add column lastHarvest date;
update transferred_to set lastHarvest = concat(year(transdate), '-12-31');
alter table transferred_to modify lastHarvest date not null;
alter table transferred_to modify transdate date not null;

To upgrade from FARMDATA1.5 to FARMDATA1.6, you must adjust several tables in
your farm information database.  The necessary commands are:

alter table labor modify username varchar(50) not null;
alter table transferred_to modify username varchar(50);
alter table dir_planted modify username varchar(50);
alter table harvested modify username varchar(50);
alter table comments modify username varchar(50);
alter table gh_seeding modify username varchar(50);
alter table tSprayMaster modify user varchar(50);
alter table fertilizer modify username varchar(50);
alter table liquid_fertilizer modify username varchar(50);
alter table fertilizer add column hours float default 0;
alter table liquid_fertilizer add column hours float default 0;
alter table pestScout add column filename varchar(200) default null;
alter table comments add column filename varchar(200) default null;
alter table diseaseScout add column filename varchar(200) default null;
alter table weedScout add column filename varchar(200) default null;
alter table pestScout add column hours float default 0;
alter table weedScout add column hours float default 0;
alter table diseaseScout add column hours float default 0;
drop view laborview;
create view laborview as
  (select id, username, ldate, crop, fieldID, task, hours, comments
   from labor)
      union
  (select -1 as id, username, hardate as ldate, crop, fieldID, 'HARVESTING' as task, hours, comments
   from harvested)
      union

      union

      hours, comments

      union

      hours, comments
