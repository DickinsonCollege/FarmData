# FarmData

FARMDATA is a web-based database system for entering and reporting crop production records, including seeding, transplanting, harvest, cover crop, compost, fertilization, irrigation, pest scouting, spray activities, packing and distribution records and customer invoicing. The FARMDATA portal, accessible by both smartphone and desktop computer, uses "smart" forms that minimize incorrect records while saving farmer time by making calculations and "remembering" important data such as field sizes, spray and seeding rates. 

For a demonstration of FARMDATA in action, visit: https://farmdata.dickinson.edu/guest.php
This page gives you live access to data for the Dickinson College Farm, although you won't be able to enter or update any data.
